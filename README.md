# Hello there
 Hello, i am Erdi. I like highly customizable softwares like linux, emacs and dwm. I also like doing general stuff like writing documents in unconventional ways like using markdown with latex functions then exporting it to pdf by pandoc and  since pandoc uses pdflatex to export pdfs, the latex functions works.
